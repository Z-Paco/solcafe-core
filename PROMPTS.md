### What We Did
- Wrote an automated test for the `/api/profile` GET handler using Jest.
- Mocked both `@supabase/supabase-js` (for the Supabase client and session) and `next/headers` (for cookies).
- Ensured the mocks were defined **before** importing the handler, so Jest would use the mocks instead of the real modules.
- Confirmed the test passes, verifying that an authenticated user receives their profile data.

### Why This Solution Worked
- **Jest replaces modules with mocks only if the mocks are defined before the module is imported.**
- By moving the `import { GET } ...` statement after the mocks, we guaranteed that our handler used the mocked Supabase client and cookies.
- This allowed us to simulate authentication and database responses, making the test pass without hitting real services or requiring a real session.
